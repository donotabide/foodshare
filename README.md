# Foodshare

## Statement of purpose
This is an application that supports the idea of a shared economy and less waste of useful resources, in this case food.
Users authenticated in the network will connect to providers of food that can be other users.
Postings on what is available is publicly published for the range of time that the provider stipulates.
The providers of food give the name and amount available as well as the minimal price, if any.
Ex: Ricardo has two more big mugs of coffee available for $1 each, four pao de queijo from the previous day $.50 each. Nick is on his way to the subway and makes the request.
As Ricardo accepts the request, Nick comes by and get the food outside of Ricardo's apartment. Nick gets a Venmo request from Ricardo based on the amount he consumed. The minimum will be paid but Nick has the option to pay for more.
